# Welcome to The Hive  Add-On Software!

The Hive is a free and open source add-on software  application, designed to highlight the Designers represented in “Go BB Design” program. Available as a native application for Android and Windows operating systems, The Hive is a C++ add-on application that is presented through a GUI which will also run through game engine and on most common processor architectures.  Creation of the original program started in 2018 by a group of like minded programmers, “Go BB Design's” The Hive is a project run by The CherryWood personnel and developed by volunteers located around the world. It is designed to be a unique library system that requires the user or visual hardware to swipe through a list of designers represented, allowing the library cover the best attributes of designers filtered in the users search inquiries. Simply put, the library filters down the location, of the project, or the user's location, by the designer's style of design or the materials they carry calculated in the user's preferences.

While The Hive is an add-on, it functions very well as a standard library application for your computer, it should be designed to be the perfect companion for upcoming AR &VR platform technology. Depending on the application it can be utilized to enhance a user's AR or VR experience.

The Hive can be used as a library utilizing, atleast three (3) attributes that are highlighted in the Designers attributes and talents: (a) Style of Design, (b) Materials the Designer has at hand, and (c) location to the project (i.e., the user maybe looking to design a project in another locatio to their current location, giving them the access to the local talents of that location).
